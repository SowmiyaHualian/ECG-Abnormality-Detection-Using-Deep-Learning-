# ECG-Abnormality-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning-
    This project focuses on developing a hybrid deep learning model for ECG abnormality detection using multi-lead ECG signals. A combination of 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks is used to accurately capture both morphological features and temporal dependencies in ECG signals.
